"You have given a rare example for generalized question. Everyone can't be SRK nor toppers, but they can be successful. There are many paths to get fame and money, but generally harder the path, lesser the people, and more fame and money. 

However success is very different set, it can overlap with fame and money but not identical with these. What is success for you, may not be the success for others. 

But be careful, doing nothing because SRK was not topper or Einstein was not hard worker will make you nothing. So, don't be delusional reading these stories and seeing motivational stories. If you are not topper, that doesn't mean you are SRK.",Reddit,india,1,1,0,1
"My favourite example is SRK. He has often spoken about his struggles in school and how he was never a top-performing student. Despite this, he went on to become one of the most successful actors in Indian cinema and a global icon. His story serves as an inspiration for students who may not be academic achievers but have other talents and strengths that can lead to success.",Reddit,india,1,1,1,1

"You don’t have to look anywhere, most of the influencers, YouTubers who have a following now(200k + followers/subscribers or even less in some cases) started with nothing and are highly successful and probably making more than some FAANG employees. 

For sure, they are cringe, for sure they have a shorter shelf life, for sure some of their private life is gone for a toss but at the end they have become highly successful. 

Some may say that only 1% of influencers have that kind of following or make money but I guess that is the case in every field. Not everyone In tech is making 50LPA.",Reddit,india,1,1,0,1
"This is wrong. SRK is just trying to be too relatable to fans.SRK attended the prestigious St Columba’s School, New Delhi whose alumni are very accomplished people like the famous cancer specialist Siddharth Mukherjee, deans of Harvard medical and business schools, a lot of IIT ians, business people, CEOs etc.

People like Rahul Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi,Lalit Modi etc are also alumni of the same school.

Even in this school filled with very smart students,SRK was awarded the school’s highest prize,the Sword of Honour because he “excelled” at his studies as well as sports. He then went on to attend the prestigious National School of Drama which has produced some of the most accomplished actors of the country.

As mentioned in SRK’s Wikipedia page:

"Bruh. Ronaldo was a child prodigy who was discovered by a scout at the age of 11. People forget this because Messi is considered to be more “talented”. Of course they work hard, but they wouldn’t be where they are without their inborn talent. So yes, like the other guy said, they have very superior genetics when compared to a normal person.",Reddit,india,1,0,0,1
"I mean yeah I do know that but then if Ronaldo would have relied more  on Talent than hardwork, as Messi does (not that that he doesn't work hard but he's got this once in a generation talent, and even though he may be short in height but his body makes up for it, the  danger tackles that he took and till now haven't recieved  a  career ending injury), as for Ronaldo yeah he's got the talent to be in top 1 percent of the folks out there but then again if he relied on that part then he wouldn't have been you know considered at that pedestal as in where Messi is considered. Like many really good players out there, he would have been in the same league as with them, you know as someone who had his years and was done with it.",Reddit,india,1,1,0,1
"Like I said, they do work really hard. Actually all these famous sports people do. But if Messi, Ronaldo etc weren’t innately more talented than other footballers,they wouldn’t be called  legends today.  

Another fact that we overlook is luck. Like for example, Ronaldo was very lucky that a scout spotted him because his dad was working with a football club or something. Not every poor child is this lucky.

Nothing like so. I mean if you look back in hindsight you'll try and find clues which were telling you not to do ""that"" thing, trying to warn you about an impending disaster, but it's only in hindsight that we think about these things. 

That day, I was hanging out with a friend and he asked me not to visit the place I was going to (and where I'll eventually get injured), and instead wanted me to hangout with him in a cyber cafe. I used to regret not listening to him, but then I realized there wasn't anything special in what he asked that day because he had done it many times earlier as well. 

My family, I think, had their signs of warning, when my grades started to plummet and I was caught bunking classes. But again, these things are normal for a kid in that age. It's kind of connecting the dots which are not there.

Not at all. I had turned into a stereotypical carefree engineering student, back in school itself. Chasing highs, loafing around, and neglecting studies. The subjects were boring and difficult, so that didn't help. I loved computers but never chemistry or physics. Had picked up some other bad habits as well. 

It was sort of my rock bottom. Every wrong decision I took out of naivety led me into that situation. That was a painful slap of reality which shook me right up to the core. Sure I would have gotten into some engineering college, slacked my way thought it, get a job in some IT labor shops, probably mba or something later on, but this is different. not saying that I'm happy that it happened, that would be too sadistic of me.

"The Hoysaleshwara and the Chennakeshava temple in Hassan, Karnataka. Two of the most famous Hoysala temples. Every sculpture here tells a story. They are ~13 km apart and are equally amazing. The architecture here will blow your mind. I remember the first time I saw the Chennakeshava temple - I was 9 years old, a history buff and I was mind blown. I never gave a fuck about seeing clowns or going to a circus, but visiting historical monuments was a my thing and I think my visit to this temple shaped me. Please hire a guide if you go here, because you will not see the intricacies in the carvings if someone doesn't tell you. The churning of the ocean, Mahabharata, ramayana, wigs, skirts..everything. If you don't want to travel 300km, you can go to the Somanatheswara Temple on Kanakpura road, 100 odd km from Bangalore. Ramachandra Guha thinks that this is the most beautiful temple in South India - if you give a fuck about his taste. Nonetheless, you will be amazed.

There's one series of carvings that particularly caught my attention. I'm quite sure it was at the Hoysaleshwara temple. It just shows everyday life. There's a carving of a woman with a donkey's face and a guy lusting over her - they're about to get married.

To be honest, the whole temple was an experience. The actual Darshan: I don't know how there aren't more stampedes there. I hardly saw the Balaji statue. The paid line is worth going to.
