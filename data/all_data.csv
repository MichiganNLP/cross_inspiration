"Good advice. Achievable chunks is important. I just set one thing I haave to do and do that. Keeping the first one short, a 10 minute task being ideal. Once you can say ""Good, Ive completed that"" it helps me get onto the next one. If its a longer task break it down into small chunks. For example if I have to read, lets say, a 100 page document I will set myself a target of read the first 10 pages, then stretch my legs. Maybe make a cup of coffee or have a piss (the first leads to the second making natural breaks). Do the next chunk, stop, stretch my legs, next chunk, etc.

"These other suggestions are great. If you're looking for regular volunteering I'd search online for local organisations and/or those that match up with your interests and values. So if you're passionate about climate change, cycling, education, whatever, look for those issues and search for a charity. Trustee roles would be great, you'd get to support them over a long period of time and help shape and support it. Getting On Board have a lot of advice about trusteeships. 

There are organisations like Pilotlight and Reach volunteering that help match people up with roles. If you're into money type things, Pro Bono Economics does the same. 

You can also search for your local council for voluntary service (CVS). They'll often have local opportunities advertised if you want something more ad hoc. 

It helps in all these examples to understand how much time and capacity you have, and what kind of roles or activities you want to do. Being realistic with yourself up front is really helpful, it means you can find roles that fit well, and you don't over commit yourself or leave a charity struggling a bit without promised support.",uk,real,1

"I wouldn't be so rash as to say you definitely need to change jobs, like some others are suggesting

I'm the same as you. I work so much better the 3 days of the week I'm in the office, and on WFH days I've procrastinated the entire day when at my worst.

It's not the job. The work I'm doing is actually quite fun. For me, it's the lack of pressure I get from being surrounded by people who will call me out for being lazy. My brain can't resist the procrastination when there's no one to keep me in check. There's also the fact that the quicker I work, the sooner I can leave. Whereas at home, I'm already surrounded by the things I want to get back to.

"*Hawksmoor* by Peter Ackroyd.

It's a novel about the construction of the Hawksmoor churches following the Great Fire of London. Meticulously historically researched, it plays with the conspiracy theories surrounding Nicholas Hawksmoor, the architect, which say that he was an occultist and deliberately incorporated pagan symbols into his designs. In the novel, he performs rituals and murders while constructing the churches. While his contemporaries, like Christopher Wren, are building airy temples to reason and enlightenment, Hawksmoor is building sinister structures that trap shadows, inspire awe, and encode a hidden darkness into London's streets that Wren and his crowd will never dispell.

The novel flips between the 1600s and the 1980s, playing with simultaneity of time, implying that what happened in the past is echoing in the (then) present, that history is overlapping.

When I read it, I was a teenager working as a rickshaw driver in central London. I was a bit strung out, having had a bit of a rough go with my mental health and overdoing it in various ways.

I read this book while learning and memorising the layout of the city, seeing how history overlapped in the architecture and how there were echoes of the past everywhere. I also had quite a few run-ins with the more dangerous side of the city, and couldn't help reflecting on how the violence and misery of the past persists into the present.

It's one of those ""some books find you at just the right time in your life"" situations, but it genuinely made me look at a city I'd lived in my entire life through fresh eyes. It also makes a great companion read to Alan Moore's *From Hell* and Iain Sinclair's *Lud Heat*, which both play in the same kind of occult London milieu.

"I did a foundation year, I'm finishing up my first year now. It was 100% worth it. For the record I am a mature student and started my foundation year as a 27 year old. I have found the last year of studying with the pandemic very challenging. 

However, I think if possible it may be beneficial to you to take a year out, focus on yourself, work on your mental health, develop your hobbies, get some part time work and just take a year to exist in the world without education. It will give you time to really think about what you want and if you still want to pursue your foundation year and degree you can (apply now but to start the following September). 

University can be overwhelming and stressful, I think if you have struggled with your A-levels due to having some difficulties recently, jumping straight into University when you aren't ready could be difficult. Don't underestimate the time it can take to get yourself into a nice, even place mentally, and rushing that journey in order to be ready for uni won't necessarily be what's best for you. 

All that being said, foundation years can 100% be worth it, you just need to work hard and be sure you're on the right path when you choose your entry point as you only get 4 years worth of funding so changing courses midway through can be problematic. 

Good luck, and I wish you the best whatever you decide!!",uk,real,1

"Will Self's 'The Book of Dave' is set in a future London, after sea level rises have turned most of the country into an archipelago. It's hilariously dark and twisted, and the language in the novel has evolved to the point where it takes you half a tick to realise what geographical or historical features are being referred to. I also loved his 'How The Dead Live', which reimagines an area of London as populated by dead souls.

Nicola Barker has a Thames Gateway trilogy, loosely connected by being set in east London and Essex, as well as their themes. I enjoyed 'Behindlings' the most of those three, and I would also recommend her 'Clear' as a snapshot of London in the early 00s.

JG Ballard is one of those authors who captured the anomie and underlying rage of the suburbs better than most. You can pick up pretty much any of his books, with my favourites being his more recent novels 'Millennium People' and 'Kingdom Come'. I can also highly recommend 'Crash' for a truly glorious piece of deliberately outrageous writing.",uk,real,1

"As someone who suffers with mental health, I have been awful in the past at getting work done and working towards deadlines... not panic typing the last few days.

I’m now in third year and I was determined to turn over a new leaf. I stick to a sleeping schedule where I wake up between 8-9 everyday, I take melatonin supplements so I fall asleep 11-12 and don’t stay up til 3 like I would before. I have a good breakfast, and eat my 5 a day in a smoothie for brain food. Then I start work around 9:30-10 and work til 6, with 30mins for lunch. I sit as a 2:1 student and this year I’m hitting high 2:1/1.

My advice is 
1. Sleep schedule is so important. Get up at the same time everyday (max an hour difference if it’s the weekend) - also great for your mental health. 
2. Don’t overwork yourself or feel guilty for not doing more, it will come in time, and there are extensions for a reason. Your productivity is not determined by the word count. Be kind to yourself.
3. Eat better and frequently 
4. HYDRATE
5. Get some exercise in, even a 20 min walk is better than nothing
6. Surround yourself with students who want to do better, and work everyday. If you surround yourself with people who leave everything to the 11th hour, you will too (I did). The top 5 people you hang around with most shape who you are, pick wisely. 
7. Don’t drink mid week, save it til Friday/Saturday- this has been easier to do as clubs are closed!

Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person.**

I would definitely try

1] talking to someone.  Not necessarily a therapist, maybe a friend

and

2]  shaking up your routine.  I don't know how much flexibility you have in your job but try compressed hours and taking one day off, try working a split shift or unusual hours, go to a co-working space, work from a cafe one day a week - basically anything to shift things around for you and see if it helps.

"There is no need to be hard on yourself. Too strict and you'll continue being ashamed and anxious. But too relaxed and you'll be waiting for something to pull you out, but who knows what and when? 

I'm very much like you, but lately I've been picking it all back up. Yesterday I read an article talking about how the first couple of hours after waking up quite literally programs your brain on how it will take the rest of the day. Grabbing something physical to read instead of scrolling reddit, or stretching and drinking water instead of lying in bed and getting a coffee. That kinda thing. Entirely anecdotal but, I tried it this morning and I've blasted out more work today than I have in the past week. So there's that little morsel. 

But I know what it's like to just not get up until past 2. I'd say as a baseline, don't beat yourself up over it. This kind of cycle is one where you naturally end up putting it at the back of your mind, but the anxiety and shame lingers and it just makes it so much worse. Surely more students are feeling this way now than students who are not. It's not your fault, your way of life has been disrupted and nothing seems to feel right. Take some time to do your favourite thing and enjoy yourself. With that emotion and drive you can come back around when you're ready. If it seems impossible now, take it step by step and you'll be amazed how fast you can go.

Failing your A-levels doesn't matter all that much in the long run if you have a goal, a willingness to find workarounds and patience.
 
Suggestions: Talk to yourself out loud about your work while you are working. Have a notebook and write down lists of things you absolutely *must* do in any given working day, and cross them off as you finish them. If you can, at least occasionally, time track and see where the bulk of your time wanders off too. If you are taking a break, set a timer. Talk to someone about them helping you with accountability; sometimes (often for me), it helps if you have someone you trust who can check in on your work and ask if you're still doing it, have made enough progress, etc. Exercise, get enough sleep, remember that caffeine is ultimately a trap for people like us; if you've ever had a cup of coffee and felt *more* tired afterwards, you should know what I mean.

"> I don't like working in advertising

> applied to so many ad agencies and never got an offer

How do you know you don't like working in advertising if you haven't got a job offer?  Often when you start the actual work is very different to how you imagined anyway. 

> I've always loved the film industry and maybe that's the only place where I feel like I'd love to work.

> I see a life of struggles, jobs I hate, almost no money

There is no such thing as a dream job.  You need to get any job and they try and develop your career through that.  Life is tough and often people end up doing work they didn't know existed.  Forget about your degree and hopes that a career you love will land in your lap and get any job.

The big industrialised farm may use a tractor but its large carbon footprint is spread over an even larger yield whereas the carbon footprint of the tools used on a small allotment are spread over a very small yield so they end up being higher per kilo of fruit and veg.

"I'm very much on the opposite end of the home/ travel scale to you! For me it does boil down to ""experience"" but as a part of that, wonder.

Walking down the Shambles, for example, reminds me of the hundreds of years before I was even thought of in which it was built, used, repurposed time and time again. And then walking along the walls, picturing what the city must have looked like before, before heading to the train museum, or yorvik. Or (as I'm more into the country) going to the moors/lakes for the day, climbing a hill and looking at the view whilst experiencing all of the fully immersive sensations (the wind, the gravel or mud underfoot etc): sure I could look at the same view on the internet, but I can't appreciate how it feels to be there.

That being said, normally I limit day trips to 2 hours travel each way (spend longer at the destination than travelling is my rule of thumb) so Edinburgh I'd probably suggest doing as an overnight stay: travel up after work on the Friday, find a nice pub for a pint, and then spend the next day exploring the place, visit the castle or underground city, climbing Arthur's seat. Edinburgh is a touch on the pricey side, but has good enough public transport that it's fairly reasonable to stay overnight on the outskirts and travel in on the morning.",uk,real,1

"How does WFH mean that you're working longer hours?

It seems there is some pretty key fact which you are not acknowledging.

Are you just procrastinating and leaving it late? If so, that would be a willpower and self-discipline issue. Or you just need more training. That is something you can work on and improve. Working only under the beady gaze of a supervisor is not really an option anymore in this age if you want to succeed as a white collar worker. You need to be able to work on your own initiative, set your own targets. Train your brain so that you *like* doing this.

Or it could be that your employer just has unrealistic standards and thinks that just because you're on WFH you should be putting in longer than the usual 40 hours? If that's so, then it's a toxic employer and you should be looking for a new job.

One word of caution is that people on this subreddit take their jobs too seriously. They tend to be very narrow, geeky people who aren't socialised and don't have much general education or knowledge. This type of demographic disproportionately draws jobsworths and hyper-specialised geeks who think they're great for slaving away 70 hours at something pointless. I would read more progressive-minded subreddits where users have more modern ideas about work-life balance. A 30 hour working week is becoming a very popular idea right now. The idea that you're inadequate because you don't want to live for your job, is a very dangerous and destructive idea to let run away with you.",uk,real,1

Sounds okay but I honestly believe if there was more money for more officers actually on the shift you’d easily see that figure reach 80%.

A lot of the stuff that goes undetected is because the enquiries needed are deemed disproportionate.

Rightly so crimes against the person are prioritised, robbery, assault, attempt murder, murder and so on all have quite high into the 90-100% detection rates.

But what that does mean is, if your car gets vandalised or your window gets smashed because it’s an insured loss, because ultimately you didn’t really get hurt resources will not be used to get you closure or justice because somewhere there’s a guy on the loose that will happily stab you over a drunken argument.

Until that underlying issue is fixed you'll just rotate back into courses where you're not motivated and will just flunk it (well, I did anyway). If you take the time out and your family are happy to support you to do so, then you get a year to explore/experiment and adjust. That way you can go back when you're ready.",uk,real,1

That's interesting because I have a theory that Monty Python is a bit of a bigger deal abroad than in the UK these days. I know Americans who are super into it and are surprised when I say it doesn't have that much profile in the UK. The Goodies certainly has even less profile, I can't recall anyone I know ever mentioning it.

As for what's replaced it, I think to a certain extent the answer is nothing really. Culture is so much more disparate now, it's harder for shows to be culturally dominant in the same way as in the past. Though of course there have been loads of great comedy shows since Python.

Otherwise can you get involved in any other projects at work to keep things interesting? Speak to your manager about how you're feeling, they might have something else you can get stuck into.

Or focus on improving your personal life. Make some evening plans, go for a walk or run or whatever you like to do, get out of the house. Go for a lunchtime walk or pop to the shops.

Work 9-5, dinner 6-7, exercise (5k/10k or gym) 7.30-8.30, then sit down and enjoy a good episode of a TV show 9-10.

Got into this routine recently and it really makes the weekdays fly in and I feel good about my self too. Sitting down to watch an episode of a show you are loving after both working hard all day and exercising is so satisfying. I don’t feel “guilty” at all seeing as I have done productive tasks all day long, would really recommend.

For motivation I just hate feeling sluggish and lazy, the thought of exercise is hard but every single time afterwards I am always glad that I’ve done it - my mental health would be so much worse without it.

"As someone who recently graduated from their masters in September, I was in almost an identical situation to you. Uni all day Monday Tuesday (including catching up on work in the evenings), then work 4/5 days a week, whilst studying either before or after work depending on when my shift was. Did that for 12 months solid. It was absolute hell and the mental exhaustion/burn out can be awful. I’m also a care leaver so understand the added stress which comes with that too. 

HOWEVER…

I am now working in my dream industry, on good money, with evenings and weekends off. People used to say I should make the most of my final year as a student due to the long hours that come with a “proper” job (as they put it). However, I haven’t had so much free time since I left college. That sounds great right? Well that will be you soon. What you need to remind yourself is that every day, no matter what task it is that you’re doing (Uni or working) it is going to result in you getting to where you want to be. The continual slog day after day with what seems like no end in sight is your way to whatever end goal it is that you so dream of. It may feel like there’s no end in sight, but in 12/18 months time you’ll be out of the other end of the horrible education/studying juggling act that you’re in at the moment. See every task between now and the end of your masters as an “enabler” to a lifestyle that’s going to be whatever you want it to be. See your next lecture, deadline, shift, as a very small step towards the end of the struggle.

I had so so so many nights where I lay awake thinking exactly what you’ve said in your post. But I PROMISE you’ll make it out the other end and it will be entirely worth it. I guess to summarise the above, allow yourself to dream of what life WILL be once you finish your masters. At times the thought of simply having weekends off was the only thing that got me out of bed in the mornings and my head back into the books.

"Motivating yourself isn't actually an action you sort 'turn on', it's provoked from something else - usually a commitment 

So when you go on to youtube and watch a motivational video, and then, as a result, feel motivated... that's actually because you made a commitment to open your browser, go to youtube, search the video, click the video, put earphones on, sit and watch all of it 

Because of those actions \^ you provoked the feeling of motivation, of course, it's easier to get motivated in that circumstance, but the method of provoking it is consistent throughout

">I don’t know, so it doesn’t matter

Not it's not. Try re-reading.

I'm well aware of the cultural significance of Monty Python. The point is that significance has faded greatly and it doesn't seem to be particularly popular with younger generations. Of Cleese's work, Fawlty Towers seems to have endured more, I hear that referenced more often.

Your argument was that Cleese's work in Python will ensure he continues to be widely beloved. My point is that it will not, because there are scores of younger people who only know him as a crotchety old man complaining about cancel culture and generally denigrating modern Britain. That's if they know him well at all, which I'd wager many will not.

>Noted that you can’t name a replacement

I gave you a more nuanced answer than just naming a replacement. I thought that might be more interesting and insightful than just naming shows. But there's loads and loads of great British comedy that younger people will find much more relevant and significant than Python. Google any list of best British comedies of the past 30 years and you'll find loads. The Office, The Thick of It, Fleabag, The Royale Family, Derry Girls. The list goes on and on.",uk,real,1

"> You can reuse the tea to make tea again.

You shouldn't be doing this. Tea leaves release lead on extended boiling (or repeated boiling). The correct way to make tea is to wait until the water/milk is almost ready to boil (bubbles just start to form) then add tea leaves. Wait for it to come to a boil, then simmer for 2-3 min before turning off the flame. If you want strong tea, add more tea leaves, don't boil it longer.

Vasco da Gama landed in 1498 there was a gap of more than 200 years between 1498 and 1757, when British first won their first military victory.

Do know of Portugese colony of Kerala, Dutch colony of Kerala, French colony of Kerala, Uzbek Kerala. Most probably you don't because they did not exist. Independence is not just independence from the British, but independence from other colonial powers too.

I joked with him and said LKG padam super bro, and he was like thambi apo Veetla vishesham polaiya? I told him, kasu ila bro download panni patukuran and he said ""dei deii"". We parted ways. 

Nice dude, he even said ""venum na sollu pa, A2B hotel nama owner dan extra sambar packet poda solavaa pa?"". Really a great personality.

"Not exactly, Khilafat got traction in India because Congress (read Gandhi if you like) see a chance to align Muslims against the British. Before that Khilafat was merely an intellectual campaign. It was Congress that changed that into a mass movement here in India. 

Using religious sentiment of people for political gain is a strategy used by our leaders for a long time. Remember how the first war of independence started. It's started  from a rumour that the bullet has fats from cows and pigs. 

And No, it's not about any global caliphate. The worldwide caliphate is a 21st-century thing. After the first world war, the Turkey caliphate was crumbling, but they managed to get a promise from the allies that they'll (Britain and France) will help Turkey to protect the Caliphate. As we know allies don't even like that idea. (Read about the Sykes-Picot agreement.) So the allies withdrew from the promise. Khilafat movement was thus a pan Islamic movement (Mass movement happened mainly in India only.) to pressure the British to keep their promise to Turkey's Sultan. Of course, the British won't have any of it and there were a lot of other promises too. Some to the French, others to various Sheikhs, clans and other leaders in the Middle East. And there was Oil too. How can an empire ignore Oil? 😋

Thus khilafat movement began and Gandhi saw a chance. To be honest, many Muslim leaders including Jinnah advised Gandhi not to mix politics with religion. But it was Gandhi's thing, you know. 😊",india,real,1

Neighbors were very friendly ,I used to get free Palamphori from Neighbor aunty.

"Your father is definitely wrong. Independence was a big deal to Kerala as well. We have had numerous freedom fighters from Kerala. From armed struggle to peaceful protests. Numerous freedom fighters were killed or tortured. Heck, even Travancore saw a lot of protests and agitations against the British despite INC directing the protests to be low-key in princely states during the Quit India movement.

Christian population was not something that fostered good relationship with British. The native Christians were probably seen as heretics by the Church of England. Many of our freedom fighters were Christians like Annie Mascarene and Accamma Cherian.

I think our state syllabus definitely covers a lot of Malayali freedom fighters, but CBSE and ICSE definitely do not cover them. A shame really. A stroll through the statues in Trivandrum itself will give you enough pointers about the freedom fighters in Kerala.",india,real,1

Trivandrum is one of those few "" it's not a place, it's an emotion "" places.
The underrated idyllic picnic town. Trivandrum is pure poetry. Unfortunately majority don't realize it. I guess you have to be here for a while to truly understand the essence of why it is. If it's just a weekend you get to be here, including visits to Ponmudi, Varkala & Kovalam, the various day sights in the city like the Padmanabha Temple, Museum & Zoo and topping off with an evening walk through the city to Kowdiar, Kuravankonam, and embracing the growing night life of the fast developing technovalley stretch, would give a great trial. Bonus points if you get to visit lesser known spots like Perumathura, Anjengo, Kadinamkulam, Murukkumpuzha, various rocks like Madavoorpara & Sasthanpara, Palode, Bonacaud + easy accessibility to numerous spots in Tamil Nadu ( Kanyakumari, Nagercoil, Chitharal etc. )and Kollam ( Monroe island, Jatayu Para, Thenmala etc.)
Also props for how relieving Trivandrum feels when you come from a busier city, to see how clean and well managed the city is, and with roads that ensure headache free traffic.

The Trivandrum district is like a mini Kerala experience. Hills, beaches, backwaters, modern city, quaint towns,   paddy fields - you name it, everything can be found here if you look right, that too accesible at lesser distances than the preferred hub cities like Kochi.

Maybe it was lack of real interaction with locals back then as they were really just opening up more & it was hard to just connect at all, the only parts i enjoyed were the far west before u hit Tibet, spent time with a Tibetan local who took me to visit some friends on the plains & i did some horse trekking on the Tibetan plateau too with some other folks i met along the way, one other memorable thing was I also got The Great wall outside Beijing to myself for a whole morning - didn't see anyone else for 2 hours hike up but a lot of my travel in China just felt empty 🤷.

"Just how much they focused on idols/art and the idea of ""seeing and being seen.""  
   
Other religions certainly have their own forms of idols and art, but they're never really explored in a spiritual sense. You may see depictions of Jesus or the virgin Mary in Christian churches or Siddhārtha Gautama or Mara in Buddhist temples but they're never any more important than any mundane piece of art. They help less imaginative worshipers understand who/what the religious leaders are talking about but they aren't needed for the religion to work.  
   
Hinduism is unique in that they treat their idols/art *as* the gods themselves rather than simple depictions. They have special rites to worship and give life to the idols. And they personify them by doing things like ""waking them up"" in the morning by shedding light on the work. The idols allow the worshipers to see the god and the god to see their disciples, which is why Hindu art always has such large and uncanny eyes.    
But they recognize that an idol becoming an incarnation of the god they're worshiping is a two way street. An idol who's abandoned by people or desecrated in some manner isn't infused with the god anymore and it's as worthless as trash. But that's okay because they can always make a new one.  
   
I especially found funny that after being done with the Durga festival they just throw the idols away that they've been worshiping and parading around for the last week. My class promptly made a joke when we learned about it about how they literally yeet the idols after they're empty.",india,real,1

1) Chess culture is extremely old in India given that the games roots are actually from the subcontinent. The Indian game Chaturanga is about 1400 years old and is the ancestor of chess and related games; it's still playable, although modern Indians generally play the standard version of chess.

2) I don't know much about science or engineering subcultures either in India or globally but there is one quirk I can tell you about. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union had an alliance with India and published countless high-quality books in countless subjects, genres, and age ranges in vernacular languages as a form of outreach. Nowadays, many Indian students in higher education highly prize Soviet science textbooks from this period and actively seek them out.",india,real,1

"I have complex feelings about India, but I have visited many places there I've enjoyed. I'm a white American guy who married into an Indian family. Almost all my travel there has been with my wife, who partially grew up there and speaks Tamil and Hindi, so that makes things easier for me than if I was traveling alone. I've lived for shortish periods in Hyderabad and Himachal, spent a good amount of time in Chennai and Powai (outside of Mumbai). Im more an outdoors person than a city person. OK, with that ample preface:

Places I've liked:
Ladakh: Leh was a cool town and the landscapes were unreal. I loved the big alpine salt lakes. Be careful with acclimation. We came by road from Srinigar. Kashmir was beautiful, but even a decade ago felt tense. 

Himachal - spent a summer there basically lugging my 2 year old around while my wife did fieldwork. It wasn't super high where we were but it was rugged and lush. We were close to Palampur for part and Mandi for the other. We flew out of Dharmashala, which I liked slightly better than I expected.

The Nilgiris - sensing a pattern? I like mountains. These are in the south and are cool and misty. Some spots are rugged. Lots of tea is grown. 

Bandavgardh, Satpura, Kanha - National parks in Madya Pradesh I believe. We saw some amazing wildlife.

Kerala backwaters - staying on a houseboat for a few nights was a really cool experience.

Hampi - took a trip feom Hyderabad to see it. It was one of my favorite archeological tourist attractions in India.

I haven't been there yet, but I'm currently pretty excited for a trip to the Andamans over Christmas that I've been planning.",india,real,1

"India had some of the most amazing sights but it was always a struggle. Walking around Delhi, some places would just smell like urine. Random people come up to you trying to sell stuff or scam you. You have different norms like while waiting in line for a train ticket, people will go body to body on you in the hot summer because if you don't others will cut in line. People don't wear deodorant as much as in the west so crowded places just smell more.

I did spend a night in a rural town doing the Golden triangle circuit and there were no beggars despite the people probably being less wealthy. 

I went to Rajasthan to see tigers and stayed at basically an all inclusive. It was a little weird because the staff was so attentive it was like having servants. I felt like the Batman movies with Alfred just there to serve you. No begging because it's basically like a gated community. 

Things like the Taj Mahal are popular for a reason and justifiably so. Dealing with all the hassles is just what you have to do to see it. If you go to less touristed areas I think the people have a much lower reliance on begging and don't do it as much.

The US has issues too. I run into unpleasant types on the train and now there are Venezuelan migrants begging in front of many stores. It's just it's way more intense in Delhi, on another level.

Food safety is an issue as well. If you always eat in hotels like many recommend then a lot of meals can be $10-20 so it's not as cheap as you might think. I saved the street food tour for the last day and did get minor food poisoning for maybe a week. Thankfully it didn't set on until after the plane ride was over.

"I've been dwelling on this for quite some time, and it pains me to see the limited influence of Marathi individuals in various fields within our own state and land.

Apart from politics, where even control seems to be slipping away to North Indians/Gujaratis behind the scenes, our beautiful Marathi culture, with its rich history including figures like Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha Empire, and revered saints and poets like Tukuram, Mukundrao, and Eknath, is at risk. Our land boasts cultural treasures like Warli paintings, Paithani sarees, Lavani dance, Kolhapuri chappal, and more, yet our own culture is now under threat. It's disheartening to feel a lack of recognition, and at times, even disdain from other communities within our own region. 

It's high time we Marathis reclaim our influence, especially considering that Bollywood is situated in Maharashtra. Marathi should rightfully be given priority, not languages like Punjabi.

it's disheartening to witness. I implore you, let's unite, form a formidable alliance to champion our community. The naysayers will doubt, but we can't let that deter us. A small start is still a start – a spark that can ignite change. Marathis, it's time to rise.

When you shower in an Indian bathroom, everything gets wet. The mirror, the toilet, the cabinets, the sink, everything. Do you like sitting on a wet toilet? I certainly don't. 

So I would like simply to segregate the wet and dry sections of the bathroom. By cordoning off the shower section by glass or curtain, and preventing the water from coming to the other side, you can achieve that. And indeed in most modern Indian apartments that is the same design that is being implemented. 

The bathroom is waterproofed anyway, I am not complaining about that.True, most American bathrooms are only waterproofed partially, and that is their design flaw. ",india,real,1

For a very reasonable fee, something like $50-60/person/day, we had an English-speaking guide, a cook, a mule handler and two mules who carried all our stuff. 

We did the five-day trek to Pangarchulla. I’m thankful we didn’t have to carry our equipment and set up camp, because honestly I’m not sure I would’ve been able to handle it. I’ve spent my life at sea level and the altitude in the Himalayas really knocked me out. I didn’t get any altitude sickness symptoms like headaches, but I was just far more winded and exhausted than I normally would’ve been. 

We didn’t get to summit Pangarchulla because the weather didn’t cooperate on the day we were supposed to go up, but it was fine. The views all along the way were spectacular and every campsite spot was just stunning.

"I wanted to do B.Sc and become a scientist. My parents forced me to do engineering. Then, when selecting engineering, they subtly forced me to take mechanical engineering, which I specifically hated. So, while doing mechanical engineering, I did as well as a person studying a degree without any interest could do, but couldn't get placement because mechanical being mechanical and me having done mechanical against my wish.

So, after completing engineering without any job, I came back home and stayed unemployed for 4 years. During this time I was giving exams for government jobs, which of course my parents wanted(duh!) But couldn't clear them, some after first stage, some after second stage. During my third year of unemployment, some friend of my family suggested my parents to admit me to CDAC course so that I might get a job. So, my parents, who believed during my school days that only mechanical had all the scope in the world and CS had ""no value"", now told me to do CDAC course. Having been unemployed for 3 years at this point, I had no option but to do this, so I did, even though I hated coding/CS.

So, I got selected in the topmost institute in CDAC and during placement I got placed in a software developer role. Now, after 4 years of unemployment, I started working in that company that mandated the new joinees go through a 3-4 month training program, and they will be confirmed only after that. Now after 4 months of training with meagre pay, some of us have been informed that there is a good chance that we would be ""released"" upon not meeting their criteria, which isn't clear in the first place. So, now, not only I'm stuck in a job whose work I have no interest in, there is the sword of unemployment hanging on my head once again and I wouldn't know what I would do if released from the job.

My father is freedom fighter from Punjab.


He worked with Nehru and Jinnah, was member of people who wrote constitution. Contested in India's first general election. Never had any political party membership. Never availed any government benefit based on Freedom fighter status. Did government job and raised kids in honest and moral way. Never used position or contacts unethical way. No complaints. Helped countless people in all possible ways. Thousand of people know him and received guidance of help in oneway of another.

">Pretty sure the workers who build Burj Khalifa or the great wall wasn't unionized

My point being without workers(with or without union), capitalists would get nothing done, ever. All capital, all services and all industrial produce ever created on earth was a direct result of labor and labor only. The bourgeoisie had no part in it. Capitalists contribute nothing towards an enterprise, they're leaches. All that they ""invest"" is stolen surplus value from laborers. 

Without laborers, nothing would exist. But without capitalists, the world would be a more prosperous place. 

Unionization only ever does one thing. It gets people better living conditions, and it gets them better wages. They'll ask you not to form an union but that's because they want you divided.",india,real,1

In my mother's family there are two small-time freedom fighters. One was a teacher of Maths and Sanskrit who left Govt School to open a new one in after Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement. He continued it even after the movement was suspended. He was arrested for carrying the flag and raising the slogan in some procession, etc. His Tamra Patra is with my Maternal Grandfather. Another guy about whom very little is known about was a radical Marxist. He is said to have escaped prison pretending to be sick and being taken to a hospital. His past is mysterious but in all probability his faction did not join mainstream politics even after independence and he was captured and killed sometime in the 50s or 60s by the Free Indian forces.

I believe in speaking truth, even if its hurtful. Downvotes may go to hell

A score of 200  in current trend is trash. Most average aspirants do manage to cross 350 any day in a difficult paper.

Neet UG is the easiest of all upcoming exams in medical field (Neet pg, neet ss, CMS upsc, PLAB, usmle).

If a person has a bad score in  neet ug, chances are he isn't fit for the next level of exams. Of course, exceptions exist, but they are called exceptions for a reason.

I'll be honest, take a maximum of 2 drops, but to be fairly honest, a jump to 600 from 200 is pretty impossibly difficult task. Just had a friend's sister take 4 years drop to from 350 to 550 and she still won't get any seat

The key to travelling in India is not where you go.

If you have the money to spend, you can get some of the best luxury experiences in the world in India.

>Just out of curiosity- before the accident did the universe ever try to signal that such an incident may occur? Like previous regular accidents etc.? 

Nothing like so. I mean if you look back in hindsight you'll try and find clues which were telling you not to do ""that"" thing, trying to warn you about an impending disaster, but it's only in hindsight that we think about these things. 

That day, I was hanging out with a friend and he asked me not to visit the place I was going to (and where I'll eventually get injured), and instead wanted me to hangout with him in a cyber cafe. I used to regret not listening to him, but then I realized there wasn't anything special in what he asked that day because he had done it many times earlier as well. 

My family, I think, had their signs of warning, when my grades started to plummet and I was caught bunking classes. But again, these things are normal for a kid in that age. It's kind of connecting the dots which are not there.

The urai (katturai) part is still highly structured and contains rhymes, alliterations, etc.

Apparently, the format was not invented by him, but his work is the oldest extant sample we currently have!

Then we come all the way down to the nineteenth century CE to Mahakavi Bharathi who wrote some 'vasana kavithai' (free verse) in order to express his understanding of certain vedantic ideas and concepts.

"Your experience depends on where you will be staying in chennai. Most foreigners stay near adyar and other posh areas. Their interaction with locals is quite minimum. Normally, employers will find stays in such an area. If the work is near omr, you will stay well outside the city in most cases. 

Enjoy sunny beaches, maybe go to private beaches if you dont want stares, a drive through the east coast road on weekends is enjoyable. There are some adventure activities on the coast again. If you want the hustle and bustle of markets visit the central city. Chennai city has a lot of historic buildings, if you want to know about british india history. Visit old temples for pallava architechture but please ask at the gate if non-hindus are allowed and if your attire is ok. Kanchipuram is an area for silk sarees. There are old libraries in the city. Chennai is a combination of old and new. You will find both very old buildings and new architechture in the same place. Same with the people, some are conservative and some are not.",india,real,1

"First things first, distance yourself from these for sure. Always remember that [if you get bad grades, you need better friends.](https://youtu.be/RQd28DTVX98) Second, decide once and for all if you want to prepare for JEE or not. If yes, choose some YouTube channels for preparing. Don't stress too much because you can cover backlogs in the future, just don't stop focusing on what you're being taught today. If not, take a deep breath and stop taking any more stress from now on. You're in class 11, start today and do only as much as you'd need to pass if you're scared. Some of my friends who qualified JEE this year didn't even have 60% in class 11th. So chill. You can definitely pass 12th and state level college exams easily. Also, your college doesn't matter. Although I would agree that getting into an IIT or NIT makes your life easier (in terms of placement) but if you work hard enough, off campus is there (if getting a job is what you're scared about). 

About not attending online classes, I don't think anyone attends online classes for purposes other than attendance. It's like school only, where the real study happens only at home (or maybe coaching for some people). If you have internet, you have everything you need to qualify atleast JEE mains. So don't worry. Start working from today and you'll see progress.

"Sri Aurobindo is a learned man. He has read the Vedas after self study of Sanskrit. He was formally educated in Greek classics and poetry. He is well read in English, French, Latin, German literature, philosophy and poetry etc.. and as per OP's demands he is the only philosopher in the classical sense of the word who could give rational and solid critique on Western and eastern cultures and ethos.  Calling him a self proclaimed magician while quoting names like Yogananda (who himself praised Aurobindo in his autobiography) and Ramakrishna (Ramakrishna mission regularly puts out articles and booklets on Sri Aurobindo as they feel his philosophy aligns very much to their ideals) to be rationalists is just laughable. I believe it was Rabindranath Tagore who said ""Sri Aurobindo is the voice incarnate of India's soul"". 

Osho is a self proclaimed learned person who didn't even read the Vedas to understand the underlying symbolism to start critiquing Indian culture. Sri Aurobindo is a Rishi in the truest sense of the word. All this becomes extremely clear when you compare Aurobindo's Secret of the Veda to Osho's comments on the Vedas calling them ritualistic garbage asking for money and fame. That useless hobo better stick to critiquing Dostoevsky's translated works. The funny thing is Osho praises both Buddha and Shankaracharya while Shankaracharya's whole work was to abolish the nihilistic philosophy of Buddhism from India and reinstate Vedanta. Osho actively worked against this culture praising Buddhism and Taoism and throwing bones to the Upanishads and Yoga every now and then, pleased everyone, earned a name for himself and accomplished nothing ultimately.

Not at all. I had turned into a stereotypical carefree engineering student, back in school itself. Chasing highs, loafing around, and neglecting studies. The subjects were boring and difficult, so that didn't help. I loved computers but never chemistry or physics. Had picked up some other bad habits as well. 

It was sort of my rock bottom. Every wrong decision I took out of naivety led me into that situation. That was a painful slap of reality which shook me right up to the core. Sure I would have gotten into some engineering college, slacked my way thought it, get a job in some IT labor shops, probably mba or something later on, but this is different. not saying that I'm happy that it happened, that would be too sadistic of me.

3. Sense of community. Where I stay in Kerala, everyone in the neighbourhood and town knows each other.

"Brother a lot of things you've written resonate with me.    
  
In my experience that numbness comes because we suppress important aspects of our life and pretend they don't matter anymore - for example in my case I pretend like I'm some badass who doesn't care for other's approval but in reality I crave people appreciating me. This is just one example, there's tonnes of such things I suppressed and eventually stopped feeling much of anything at all.    
  
Mindfulness and meditation is something that helps I feel. Life isn't about blocking negative emotions, instead you feel them in all their intensity and let them pass. If I had a bad interaction with someone and I 'suppress' whatever negative emotions arose in me, it doesn't mean the negative emotions don't exist anymore, they'll just haunt me for years to come instead. The better way is to let it take over and no matter how humongous the pit in my stomach seems, it will pass in no more than 5 minutes.  
  
You can't just block the negative emotions, if you try that you block all positive emotions as well - it's an all or nothing game. 
  
Another 'hack' is to exercise regularly so that you have happy hormones flying around on your system. You will be surprised how the same situation seems so very different before and after you get the injection of happy hormones.

As a society, we don’t teach kids to deal with failure and don’t instill the belief that failure is a necessary step to the path to success. That failing is okay. Whats important is to learn from failure, get up and try again. 

As parents, their job is not just to brag about their kid’s achievements to gain social capital or hide their face when things don’t go well. Their job is to do these:

1) Talk to your brother with kindness and tell him failing is okay. An exam is not what defines him
2) talk to him to understand why did the failure actually happen ( honesty is important here, should not be a blame game)
3) Take steps to fix the shortcomings identified in 2 - maybe they get him coaching for math!

what? You mean jog? That's a new one. Doesn't anyone stop you? 

Anyway here are my tips - 

1. I carry these things whenever i have to be out the whole day which includes going to work too - Water, Sanitizer, Wet tissues, Strong perfume/deo, Power bank, some dry fruits, emergency wallet with atleast Rs 2000/- and driving licences, one debit/credit card and identity proof. Also an umbrella/raincoat for monsoons. 

2. When traveling, always factor in 30 to 60 minutes extra each way. This ensures you reach either early or on time wherever you want to go. Reaching early or on time is always better than late. 

3. Have cooked food when out, or carry your own snack. Always carry water because you never know when you may need it. 

4. Cab apps are helpful. Most people dont even know they exist despite the marketing buzz. I was stuck on the harbour line due to heavy rains a few weeks ago, Almost everyone in the train decided to wait for the train to move and many decided to go home by hunting for cabs. I just walked 5 minutes away from the station and got myself an Ola to go back home. Easy peasy.

"I feel everything you say, man. I followed one motto while studying for the NEET - work hard, play hard.

Like other Redditors have mentioned, you just gotta find the balance between studying and relaxing by making a schedule, figuring out at what times of the day you happen to be the most alert and active, and so on. I used to go entire days relaxing and not studying anything and that is okay! But do try and go over the syllabus at least once. Use Youtube vids if you can. 

And do NOT skip out on proper meals or sleep - because let's be real you'll have to do sacrifice both of them while in college, especially the food lol.

(I'm two years into the college life already, that's how I know rip)

One more thing would be to ensure your board examination marks are on-point, because it's always a criteria while applying to any college.

And the most important thing imo is - don't feel discouraged if you don't get in; it DOES NOT MEAN THE END OF THE WORLD. I couldn't clear NEET inspite of giving it twice but I did get into a really good college soon enough.

The last thing would be to pretty much ignore what your relatives say, because most Indian relatives have nothing better to do other than compare and talk shit about everyone all day, every day.

"It's not a myth. It's a reality. Just google about the demographics and you'd find businesses owned by Marathis that can be counted on fingers. 🙂. Maharashtra is the most advanced state of India but Marathi people are very innocent and tricked by outsiders easily. 😔

Also in my opinion the number of medium, small scale businesses matter equally when it comes to judging how successful a community is. But sadly there also we see a domination by non-marathis. For eg: Hotels - Shetty's, Punjabis, Kirana - Marwadis, Malls - North Indians. Mumbai is mostly run by Gujjus these days. The percentage of Marathi here has fallen significantly. (You can google this).

I'm not saying that Marathis are weak, just saying the number is still comparatively lower despite being native to Maharashtra.

I know for a fact that Punjabi, Parsi people have monthly community meetings here in Maharashtra on how they can increase the influence of their community. Pretty sure other communities might have the same. Never came across such a thing done by Marathi people. I see young people want to be karyakartas here and go behind politicians.

I always liked polity growing up so I decided to give mhcet and scored well and got into glc . Today if you will ask me my biggest regret is not giving clat coz my parents were not supportive.

"You have given a rare example for generalized question. Everyone can't be SRK nor toppers, but they can be successful. There are many paths to get fame and money, but generally harder the path, lesser the people, and more fame and money. 

However success is very different set, it can overlap with fame and money but not identical with these. What is success for you, may not be the success for others. 

But be careful, doing nothing because SRK was not topper or Einstein was not hard worker will make you nothing. So, don't be delusional reading these stories and seeing motivational stories. If you are not topper, that doesn't mean you are SRK.",india,real,1

To be honest, the whole temple was an experience. The actual Darshan: I don't know how there aren't more stampedes there. I hardly saw the Balaji statue. The paid line is worth going to.
