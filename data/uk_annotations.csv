"Michael Palin Britain's nicest man. A great ambassador for travel. Incredible performances and comedy writing throughout the Monty Python series and films, and a few other bits and pieces. Edit - Probably my favourite thing about the man, apart from the way he interacts on his travels, is the fact he can't seem to keep a straight face on stage. He's clearly smirking in the 'Biggus Dickus' scene, which makes me wonder how many takes they did before giving up and using that one.",1,1,0,1

I don't know enough about him to know if he's all good but I find James Timpson's (of Timpson's the cobblers) approach of training and hiring prison-leavers/ex-convicts inspiring. Giving people a second chance is very powerful (and also reduces the risk of reoffending).,0,1,1,1
"Not a particularly famous guy, but Charles Cockell, professor of astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh.

"Riz Ahmed. He's not only an amazing actor but he's absolutely smashing the mainstream stereotype of what Muslims/British Pakistani roles are on screen and behind them. Marcus Rashford, for everything. He's a role model for those who don't care about the beautiful game. Jacqueline McKenzie the human rights/Windrush lawyer. Ian McKellen (& Patrick Stewart as a side) for his on/off screen stuff for gay rights and the beautiful friendship he has with Stewart is everything anti toxic masculinity.",1,1,0,1
"Elton John. He's not everybody's cup of tea, but the man is a solidified icon, for multiple reasons. He & Bernie Taupin have created some of the best known songs in the English language, brought to life by Elton's virtuosic skills with piano & vocals. On top of that, he's also one of the greatest LGBTQ+ icons to date. It took balls to be as flagrant with his identity back when he came out, especially as high-profile as he was. I say this as a heterosexual man, not for internet points or to virtue-signal, but purely to make my perspective clear to any readers. Sure, you can talk about his wealth & wealth inequality, but that's another can of worms & frankly, there's plenty of bigger fish to fry in that pond. Anyway, yeah, global treasure, let alone national.",1,1,0,1
I remeber watching the 2012 olympics and being struck at how full of life Nicola Adams was. I really like how happy she is and I find her story really inspiring. Whenever I see her on TV she always brings a big daft smile to my face 😊,1,1,0,1

They're now working on the Vimes Boot Index to show a realistic measure of inflation (as the RPI doesn't accurately reflect the price impact of lower priced goods that many low income people rely upon).

Edit:corrected **BRIAN BLESSED!**",1,0,1,1
David Attenborough. I feel that this one doesn't even need explaining. Single-handedly done more to raise the profile of environmental issues than perhaps anyone on the planet. Plus hrs the nation's de facto grandfather figure.,1,0,1,1
David Attenborough has been mentioned and it might seem cliche however he created a genre of educational entertainment that has endured and has taken pains to point out the damage our species is doing. Now in his 90s he is a prominent voice in the need to improve our actions towards being sustainable in the ecosystems of the world.,1,0,1,1

I met him at his book signing and he laughed because I was shaking with excitement at meeting him. I said he was a real inspiration to be so honest about his struggles. Then he gave me a hug and I got masses of brownie points getting a signed book for my Mum!,1,1,1,1
Ahh I love this response! She is the best. I met her when I was at primary school when I was about 10 years old. Our teacher asked who knew her and could name her books. I reeled some off so I was able to meet her. Wish I knew where my signed book was. Was awesome her reading to us :),1,1,1,1
"Totally agree. She introduces some incredibly rough topics with such empathy and humour, and makes them relatable to her audience. Kids can recognise themselves and other people in their lives; whilst as an adult, you can go back and put your finger on *exactly* what was so fucked up - beyond the obvious - in these stories. The Illustrated Mum, Bed and Breakfast Star, and The Suitcase Kid (among others) are heartbreaking for me as a grownup with *a lot* of safeguarding training under my belt. She is the unacknowledged master of the first person voice. She manages to capture her young protagonist's personalities, without talking down to her target age group or coming across as preaching on social topics.",1,1,1,1

When it came time to leave the club, rather than play for somebody else and possibly have to pay against the club he'd played all his life for, he switched codes and played Union for Yorkshire Carnegie for a while, but he's been an absolute colossus since retiring for raising awareness of motor neurone disease, raising over £1m running 7 marathons in 7 days, and another mil running 101 miles in 24hrs. His best friend and former teammate Burrow was diagnosed with the disease in 2019 and he's said he's not going to stop fundraising until a cure has been found. Great guy.",1,1,0,1

I don’t know that he has any fancy accolades as such, but he’s there regular as clockwork on my TV, over 1,000 episodes of being funny, slightly eccentric, kind, charming and full of advice for avid buyers.

"My answer is Steven Bartlett. He's a self made millionaire under 30 who struggled with schooling and is now a very humble and open person discussing his flaws. Not the most inspiring but listening to his podcasts and the guests he talks with and the quality, depth and openness of his podcasts are what I find inspiring and have helped me look at things in different ways. I recommend his diary of a CEO podcast and particularly the ones with Jimmy Carr, Ant Middleton (also a pretty inspiring character), James Smith and Jay Shetty to name a few.",1,1,0,1
"The thing I love about him is how he exposes the class divide in education, but the education that happens outside the classroom that should happen in the classroom. Typically, middle class children are taught about money, debt and credit, how it works and how to make money work for you. How to save money, open a pension, about contracts, about their rights, most importantly how to have hope and feel in control of your finances. He’s like the financial Penn and Teller, lifting the curtain, to show what others already know and do, the knowledge they have been using in their social circle to their advantage, so we all can too.",1,1,0,1

For these people, it’s a loan because you WILL pay it all back plus interest. Really fucked me off that he ignored these people and tried to oversimplify the whole thing.",1,1,1,1
